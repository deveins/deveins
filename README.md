# 👋 Hey, I’m Deveins

> _Born to build. Code in the veins._

I’m a developer who doesn’t just write code — I **live in it**.  
I believe that creativity, clarity, and intention belong in every function,  
every loop, and every project.

### 🧬 What I Do
- 💻 Build clean, thoughtful front-end experiences  
- 🎯 Focus on **JavaScript**, **HTML/CSS**, and deep problem solving  
- 🔍 Obsess over logic, structure, and simplicity  
- 🪄 Love creating tools that feel like *magic, but with reason*
